    <h1>Love Songs</h1>


<p>I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
  Hope you smile when you listen</p>
Ain't no competition, just competing for attention</p>
And you like: I'm not on no games</p>
Well, baby, I been peeping and you ain't been the same
<p><B>Like, who been on your mind? Who got your time?</B></p>
<p><B>Who you been vibing with and why I can't make you mine?</B></p>
You used to be texting me, checking me, calling me your slime</p>
And now you treat me like my worth less than a dime</p>

And if we paint a perfect picture, we can make it last forever</p>
And you the only one I want to wear my orange sweater</p>
I told you I am down for the worse or the better</p>
But I keep sticking to you 'cause them four stupid letters</p>

You got me singing love songs (love songs, love songs)</p>
You got me singing love songs (love songs, love songs)</p>
You got me singing love songs (love songs, love songs)</p>
You got me singing love songs (love songs, love songs)</p>

You got me singing love songs</p>
